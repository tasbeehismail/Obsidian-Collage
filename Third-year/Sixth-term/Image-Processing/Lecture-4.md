- **Correlation** of two signals is convolution between **one** signal with **inverse** of other signals.
- In **correlation** process one of the signals is rotated by 180 degree.
- Can make identical results if the signals are rotationally *symmetric*.
```bash
Convolution => two + third = cross-correlation
Correlation => signal > signal  = cross-correlation
Amplitude = cross-correlation X target signal 
```

k = 1/9 -> mean filter which smooths an image
k = 121, 000, -1-2-1 -> sobel edge detector

# Frequency analysis: 
means representing the discrete signal as a function of frequency
- Light â€“as a signal- is decomposed into different frequency components when emerging outside a *prism*.
- Signal *spectrum* represents signal energy/power as a function of frequency.
	- Low frequency signals
	- High frequency signals
	- Bandpass signals

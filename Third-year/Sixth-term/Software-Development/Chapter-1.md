## System Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
### 1. Planning: 
The fundamental process of understanding why an information system should be built.
- Steps: 
	1. Project initiation (How will it lower costs or increase revenues?)
	2. Project management (Create work plan)
### 2. Analysis:
Answers the questions of who will use, what the system, where and when will be used.
+ Steps:
	1. Analysis Strategy: analysis of current system.
	2. Requirements gathering: used to build a set of analysis models.
	3. System proposal: to decide whether the project should continue to move forward.
### 3. Design:
The user interface, forms, reports, specific programs, databases, files will be needed or used.
+ Steps:
	1. Design Strategy: designed by the company or outside.
	2. Architecture Design: describes what infrastructure that will be used.
	3. Database and File Specifications: what and where the data will be stored.
	4. Program Design: what programs need to be written and what they will do.
### 4. Implementation: (expensive and longest phase)
The system in it is either developed or purchased (in packaged software).
- Steps:
	1. System Construction: build and test the system as it designed.
	2. Installation: Prepare to support installed system.
	3. Support Plan: includes post-implementation review.

## Project Sponsor:  
- Who recognizes the strong business need for a system, in both tangible and intangible ways.
- Make sure that the project is moving in the right direction.
- Serves as the primary point of contact.
- Determine the size and scope of the project.
- Complete the system request as part of a formal system selection process.
#### System Request: 
The document that describes the business reasons for building a system and the value that system is expected to provide.

## Feasibility Analysis
Guides the organization and identifies the important risks.
+ Areas:
	+ Technical Feasibility: strives to answer: "Can we build it?"
		+ Familiarity with the application
		+ Familiarity with the technology
		+ Project size
		+ Compatibility with the technology already exists
	+ Economic Feasibility (cost-benefit): "Should we build it?"
		+ Steps: 
			1. Identify costs (Development, Operational) and benefits (Tangible, Intangible)
			2. Assign values to costs and benefits
			3. Determine cash flow
			4. Assess project's economic value (ROI, BEP, NPV)![[ROI.png]]
	+ Organizational Feasibility: (How well the system will be accepted by its users)

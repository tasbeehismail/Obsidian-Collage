## Network Access Protection (NAP)
+ is a set of operating system components that provide a platform for protected access to private networks.
+ In it, different providers (ISPs) and telecommunications companies set up their **POPs** **(Points of locations/Presence)**, allowing any business to easily use their connectivity services.

#### Wireless networking:
+ with a base station :. wireless network is a computer network that uses wireless data connections between network nodes.
#### Ad hoc networking:
+ is a type of local area network designed to connect two or more wireless devices without the need for typical infrastructure such as routers or access points.

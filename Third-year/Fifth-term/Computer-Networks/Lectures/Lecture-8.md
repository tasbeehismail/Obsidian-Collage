### The Network Devices (Nodes)
+ NIC Card:
	+ is used to physically connect host devices to the network media.
	+ Each NIC is identified by a unique code called a Media Access Control (MAC) address.
	
+ Repeater: is a network device used to regenerate a signal.

+ Hub: they take a group of hosts and allow the network to see them as a single unit.
	+ Ethernet hub: s a network device that connects various network nodes, in an Ethernet mode, in a star configuration.
	
+ Switch: They can determine if data should remain on a LAN and transfer data only to the connection that needs it.

+ Bridge: convert network data formats and perform basic data transmission management.

+ Router: can regenerate signals, concentrate multiple connections, convert data transmission formats, and manage data transfers. (connect LAN to WAN).

+ Gateway:Â is a piece of networking hardware used in telecommunications that allows data to flow from one discrete network to another.

+ Firewall: is a network device or software for controlling network security and access rules.

### Network Media: 
1. Copper Cable: The most common, easiest, quickest, and cheapest form of network media to install.
	1. Coaxial Cables: It can be run longer distances than Twisted pair Cables.
		+ Speed: 10-100Mbps
		+ Cost: Inexpensive
		+ Media and connector size: Medium
		+ Maximum cable length: 500m*
		
	2. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP):
		+  Speed: 0-100Mbps
		+ Cost: Moderate
		+ Media and connector size: Medium to large
		+ Maximum cable length: 100m
		
	3. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):a four-pair wire medium used in a variety of networks.
		+ Speed: 10-100-1000 Mbps*
		+ Cost: Least Expensive
		+ Media and connector size: Small
		+ Maximum cable length: 100m
		
2. Fiber Optic Cable: Glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit.
	+ Speed: 10-100's Gbps
	+ low error rate

## Communication Protocols
**Internet Protocol Suite**: It is the defining set of protocols for the Internet. (Also called TCP/IP)

**IEEE 802**: It is a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks. (for OSI model)

**Ethernet**: It is a family of protocols used in wired LANs, described by a set of standards together called IEEE 802.3

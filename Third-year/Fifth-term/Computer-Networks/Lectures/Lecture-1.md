## Technology Revolution
+ Gathering: process of collection information from different sources about a particular topic or issue.
+ Distribution: the processes of share data and informations among groups, individuals...
+ Processing: processing data includes number of steps (acquiring, inputting, validating, manipulating, storing, outputting, communicating, retrieving, and disposing).
+ Creating: Converting data to information.

## What is a Computer Network
-> <span class="green">A set of communication elements</span> (computers, printers, mobile phones, Routers, switches..) <span class="green">connected by communication links </span> (optic fiber, coaxial cable, twisted pair, wireless(radio, microwave, satellite)).
### Topologies:
- Ring
- Star
- Bus
- Tree
- Mesh

-> **Internet:** Network of Networks
-> **World Wide Web:** A distributed systems run on the top of Internet.
-> **Distributed System:** also known as distributed computing, is a system with multiple components located on different machines that communicate and coordinate actions in order to appear as a single coherent system to the end-user (middleware).
	- High degree of cohesiveness and transparency.
	- A software system built on top of a network.

## Uses of Computer Networks:
1. Business Applications: 
   - Resource sharing
   - Providing communication medium for separated employees (BBS or CBBS computer bulletin board service)
   - Doing business electronically 
   - High reliability
   - Saving money
   - Scalability
   -> **Client-Server model**: clients are requesting resource and servers providing that resources.
   
2. Home Applications:
   + Networks for people:
	   + Access to remote information
	   + Person-to-Person communication
	   + Interactive entertainment
	   + Ubiquitous computing
   -> **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: network in which interconnected nodes ("peers") share resources amongst each others without use of centralized admin system (server).
   
 | Tag | Example |
 | ----| --------- | 
 | B2C | order in-line|
 | B2B| manufacture order from supplier |
 | G2C | tax |
 | C2C | second-hand on-line |
 | P2P | music sharing |

3. Mobile Users:

 | Wireless | Mobile | Example |
 | ----|----| --------- | 
 | No | No | Desktop computers in offices|
 | No | Yes | Notebook computer used in a hotel room |
 | Yes | No | Unwired buildings |
 | Yes | Yes| handheld computer |

## Types of Networks
+ PAN: square meter (1 m)
+ LAN: room, building, campus (10 m -> 1 km)
+ MAN: city (10 km)
+ WAN: country, continent (100 km -> 1000 km)
+ Internet: planet (>= 10,000 km)

## Network Hardware
+ **Broadcast Links**: used to send out or transmit by streaming over the Internet.
	+ single communication channel shared by all machines.
	+ broadcasting: a special code in address field.
	+ multicasting: the sender sends data to multiple receivers across LANs or WAN.
	+ used by localized networks (or satellite).
+ **Point-to-Point Links**: based system provides dedicated links between two devices.
	+ many hops,
	+ multiple routes.
	+ used by large networks.

## Component of Network: 
+  At least 2 computers.
+ Cables that connect the computers to each other (wireless).
+ A network interface device on each computer (NIC).
+ Switch. Hubs are outdated.
+ Network operating system software.

## Wireless LAN Advantages:
+ It is easier to add or move workstations.
+ It is easier to provide connectivity in any areas.
+ Installation can be fast and easy.
+ Access to the network can be from anywhere within range.
+ Can be used for portable or semi-permanent buildings.
+ Can move the computer suite with laptop on mobile carts.
## Wireless LAN Disadvantages:
+ As the number of computers increases, the transfer rate decrease.
+ May be necessary to replace wireless cards and/or access points.
+ Some applications such as video streaming will be more effective on a wired LAN.
+ Security requires configuration.
+ Devices will only operate at a limited distance from an access point.

## PAN (Personal Area Network)
+ is a computer network used for data transmission amongst devices such as computers, telephones, tablets and personal digital assistants.
+  Also Know as HAN (Home Area Network)

## LAN (Local Area Network)
+ Ethernet has evolved and has seen significant improvements in regard to speed and efficiency.
+ Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).
+ Its data speed reach up to 10 Gbps.

## CAN (Campus Area Network)
+ Larger than LAN, but smaller than MAN
+ For small businesses.
+ They can be spread across several buildings that are fairly close to each other so users can share resources.

## MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
+ The size range anywhere from 5 to 50km in diameter.
+ This could be an ISP or telecommunications company that sells its services to end-users in that metropolitan area.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)
+ exist over a large area.
+ Data travels through telephone or cable lines.
+ Requires a Modem.

## SAN (Storage Area Network)
+ Referred to as a Sub network or special purpose network.
+ Its special purpose is to allow users on a larger network to connect various data storage devices with clusters of data servers.

## VPN (Virtual Private Network)
+ a private network that can access public networks remotely.
+ uses encryption and security protocols.
+ **Authentication**is provided to validate the identities of the two peers.
+ **Confidentiality**provides encryption of the data to keep it private from prying eyes.
+  **Integrity** is used to ensure that the data sent between the two devices or sites has not been tampered with.

## Client/Server Network
+ Â The server is a central computer that is continuously available to respond to requests from clients for file, print, application, and other services.
+ Most network operating systems adopt the form of a client/server relationship.
+ Typically, desktop computers function as clients, and one or more computers with additional processing power, memory, and specialized software function as servers.
## Peer to Peer Network
+ very small networks.
+ Each workstation has equivalent capabilities and responsibilities.
+ Does not require a switch or a hub.
+ These types of networks do not perform well under heavy data loads.

## Topologies:
#### 1. Bus: **All devices are connected to a central** cable, called bus or backbone.

#### 2. Ring: All devices are connected to one another in the shape of a closed loop.

#### 3. Star: All devices are connected to a central hub.

#### 4. Tree/Hierarchical

#### 5. Mesh: Each host has its connections to all other hosts.

### Wireless Networks:
+ Wireless network is a type of computer network that uses wireless data connections for connecting network nodes.
+ Example: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi

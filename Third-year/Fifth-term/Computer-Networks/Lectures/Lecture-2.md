## Broadcast networks
+ Unicasting: is a single communication, direct request sent from one host to another, and only the two hosts interact over the established route. (like: requesting HTTP data).
+ Broadcasting: take messages from a single sender and transmit to all endpoints on the network. (like: radio, television).
+ Multicasting: can be one-to-many or many-to-many distribution.
-> Can e further divided into static (divide time into
discrete intervals and use a round-robin algorithm) and dynamic (either centralized or decentralized).

-> **Standard** has been adopted for **MANs**, is called **DQDB** (Distributed Queue Dual Bus).

-> **Subnet in WAN**: consists of Transmission lines(circuits, channels, or trunks) and Switching elements(packet switching nodes, intermediate system, data switching exchanges, routers).        

-> Virtual Private Network (**VPN**): is an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network.

– WAN = subnet + hosts
– Subnet + hosts -> WAN -> network
– Cable + hosts -> LAN -> network
– Many interconnected networks -> internetworks.

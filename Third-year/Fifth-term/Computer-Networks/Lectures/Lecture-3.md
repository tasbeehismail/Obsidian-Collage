**Protocol:** is an agreement between the communicating parties on how communication is to proceed.
**Peers**: are the entities comprising the corresponding layers on different machines.
*******
**Service Interface**: defines which primitive operations and services the lower layer makes available to the upper one.

-> It is common that different hosts use different implementations.
*******
 **Network Architecture**: A set of layers and protocols.
 **Protocol Stack**: A list of protocols used by a certain system, one protocol per layer.
 *******
 **Virtual communication**: is the use of digital tools to relay information between people who are not physically face to face.
 **Peer communication**: The exchange of information, product reviews, and comments by peers in one's social virtual community.

 **Connection-oriented service:** a technique that is typically used to transport and send data at session layer.
 **Connectionless service**: enables data to be transferred between network endpoints.

******
**Service**: is a set of primitives (operations) that a layer provides to the layer *above* it.
-> is like an abstract data type or an object in an object-oriented language.
**Protocol**: is a set of rules governing the format and meaning of the packets, or messages that are exchanged by the peer entities *within* a layer.
-> relates to the implementation of the service.

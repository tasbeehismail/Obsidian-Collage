## **<span class="red">Introduction</span>**
- **Face Recognition** is a complex, software-based technique.
- It analyzes the unique shape, pattern, and positioning of facial features.
- Compares scans to records stored in:
  - Central or local databases.
  - Smart cards.
## **<span class="red">What is Biometrics?</span>**
- **Definition**: Unique measurable characteristics of a human being.
- Used to automatically recognize an individual's identity.
- **Two Types**:
  1. **Physiological**: Physical traits (e.g., fingerprints, face).
  2. **Behavioral**: Actions (e.g., voice, gait).
- **Biometric System**: Integrated hardware and software for biometric identification.
## **<span class="red">Why Choose Face Recognition?</span>**
- **Advantages**:
  - No physical interaction required.
  - Accurate with high enrollment and verification rates.
  - No expert needed to interpret results.
  - Uses existing infrastructure.
  - Passive identification.
## **<span class="red">Types of Face Recognition</span>**
1. **Verification**:
   - Compares an individual with who they claim to be.
2. **Identification**:
   - Compares an individual to all others in the database.
   - Produces a ranked list of matches.
## **<span class="red">Stages of Identification</span>**
1. **Capture**: Capture the behavioral sample.
2. **Extraction**: Extract unique data and create a template.
3. **Comparison**: Compare the template with a new sample.
4. **Match/Non-Match**: Decide if the new sample matches the template.
## **<span class="blue">3D Graphical Models of Faces</span>**
- Used to create detailed representations of facial features for recognition.
## **<span class="red">Components of Face Recognition</span>**
1. **Enrollment Module**:
   - Scans and captures digital or analog images of personal characteristics.
2. **Database**:
   - Handles compression, processing, and storage of captured data.
3. **Identification Module**:
   - Interfaces with the application system
## **<span class="blue">Enrollment Module Workflow</span>**
1. **Preprocessing**: Prepare the captured image.
2. **Analysis**: Extract features and create a template.
3. **Database**: Store the template.
4. **User Interface**: Interact with the system.
## **<span class="blue">Verification Module Workflow</span>**
1. **Preprocessing & Segmentation**: Prepare and segment the face.
2. **Analysis & Scoring**: Compare the face with stored templates.
3. **Accept/Reject**: Decide if the face matches.
## **<span class="red">Performance Metrics</span>**
- **False Acceptance Rate (FAR)**: Incorrectly accepting an unauthorized user.
- **False Rejection Rate (FRR)**: Incorrectly rejecting an authorized user.
- **Response Time**: Time taken to process and match.
- **Threshold/Decision Threshold**: The level at which a match is accepted.
- **Enrollment Time**: Time taken to enroll a new user.
- **Equal Error Rate (EER)**: The point where FAR and FRR are equal.

## **<span class="red">The Software Process</span>**
1. **Detection**: Detect the face in an image.
2. **Alignment**: Align the face for accurate comparison.
3. **Normalization**: Normalize the image for consistency.
4. **Representation**: Represent the face in a format suitable for comparison.
5. **Matching**: Compare the face with stored templates.
## **<span class="red">Advantages of Face Recognition</span>**
- Convenient and socially acceptable.
- Easy to use.
- Inexpensive compared to other biometric systems.
## **<span class="red">Disadvantages of Face Recognition</span>**
- Cannot distinguish between identical twins.
## **<span class="red">Applications of Face Recognition</span>**
- **Government Use**:
  1. Law enforcement.
  2. Security and counterterrorism.
  3. Immigration.
- **Commercial Use**:
  1. Daycare.
  2. Residential security.
  3. Voter verification.
  4. Banking using ATMs.

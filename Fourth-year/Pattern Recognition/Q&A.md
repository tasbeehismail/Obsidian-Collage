### 1. What are classifiers and their types?
**Answer:**
Classifiers are algorithms or models used in pattern recognition and machine learning to assign a class label to an input based on its features. They are used to categorize data into different classes or categories.
#### Types of Classifiers:
- Linear Classifiers:
  - lecture (6) mentions LDA as a linear method that finds the projection that best separates two classes.
- Non-linear Classifiers:
  - lecture (6) discusses non-linear SVM, which uses kernel functions to map data into higher dimensions where a linear hyperplane can separate them.
- Tree-based Classifiers:
  - lecture (6) explains Random Forest, which is a collection of decision trees used for classification and regression tasks.
- Neural Network-based Classifiers:
  - lecture (5) introduces neural networks as a method of computing based on the interaction of multiple connected processing elements, which can be used for classification tasks.

### 2. **Performance of Accuracy**
**Answer:**
The performance of a classifier is often measured by its **accuracy**, which is the ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances. However, accuracy alone may not always be the best measure, especially in imbalanced datasets.
#### Performance Metrics:
- lecture (1) mentions
	- **Error Rate:** defined as the probability of misclassification.
	- **Speed**
	- **Cost**
	- **Robustness**
	- **Reject option**
	- **Return on investment**
- lecture (2) discusses **FAR** and **FRR** as performance metrics in face recognition systems.
	- False Acceptance Rate [FAR]
	- False Rejection Rates [FRR]
	- Response time
	- Threshold/decision Threshold
	- Enrollment time
	- Equal error rate

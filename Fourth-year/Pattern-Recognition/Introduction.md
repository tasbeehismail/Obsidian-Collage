## **<span class="red">What is a Pattern?</span>**
- A set of instances that:
  - Share regularities and similarities.
  - Are repeatable.
  - Are observable, sometimes partially, using sensors.
  - May have noise and distortion.
## **<span class="red">What is Pattern Recognition?</span>**
- **Definition**: Scientific discipline concerned with the description and classification (recognition) of patterns (objects).
- **Applications**:
  - Decision making.
  - Object and pattern classification.
## **<span class="red">Human Perception</span>**
- Humans have sophisticated skills for sensing their environment and taking actions based on observations.
- **Examples**:
  - Recognizing faces.
  - Understanding spoken words.
  - Reading handwriting.
  - Distinguishing fresh food by smell.
- **Goal**: Give machines similar capabilities.
## **<span class="red">Pattern Recognition in Machines</span>**
- **Challenges**:
  - Humans perform tasks unconsciously, making it hard to program machines to replicate.
  - Example: Recognizing faces involves analyzing structures like eyes, nose, and mouth.
- **Process**:
  - Analyze sample images to capture patterns.
  - Identify or recognize patterns as members of known categories.
## **<span class="red">Classes in Pattern Recognition</span>**
- **Definition**: A collection of objects that are similar but not identical, distinguishable from other classes.
- **Types**:
  - **Known Classes**: Classes are predefined.
  - **Unknown Classes**: Classes are created after inspecting objects.
## **<span class="red">Human vs. Machine Perception</span>**
- Humans are influenced by natural pattern recognition when developing algorithms.
- Machine perception helps understand natural systems but also uses numerical techniques without natural correspondence.
## **<span class="red">Machine Perception Applications</span>**
- Speech recognition.
- Fingerprint identification.
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
- DNA sequence identification.
## **<span class="blue">Example: Fish Sorting</span>**
- **Problem**: Sorting fish by species using optical sensing.
- **Steps**:
  1. Capture images and extract features (length, lightness, width, fins, mouth position).
  2. Preprocess: Segment fish from the background.
  3. Feature extraction: Reduce data by measuring specific features.
  4. Classification: Pass features to a classifier.
## **<span class="red">Feature Extraction</span>**
- **Goal**: Extract features that are good for classification.
- **Good Features**:
  - Objects from the same class have similar feature values.
  - Objects from different classes have different values.
## **<span class="red">Basic Concepts</span>**
- **Pattern**: A set of observations.
- **Feature Vector (x)**: A vector of measurements in feature space X.
- **Hidden State (y)**: Cannot be directly measured; patterns with the same hidden state belong to the same class.
- **Classifier**: A decision rule that assigns a hidden state based on observations.
## **<span class="blue">Example: Fish Classification</span>**
- **Features**: Lightness and width.
- **Linear Classifier**: Decision boundary based on feature values.
- **Cost of Misclassification**: Adjust decision boundary to minimize errors.
## **<span class="red">Overfitting and Underfitting</span>**
- **Overfitting**: Model is too complex, performs well on training data but poorly on new data.
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple, performs poorly on both training and new data.
- **Goal**: Achieve a good fit that generalizes well to new data.
## **<span class="red">Emerging Applications</span>**
- Data mining (e.g., fraud detection).
- Biometrics (e.g., face, iris, fingerprint recognition).
- Machine vision (e.g., automated inspection).
- Character recognition (e.g., ATMs).
- Document recognition (e.g., spam detection).
- Medical imaging (e.g., cancer diagnosis).
- Bioinformatics (e.g., DNA sequence analysis).
- Remote sensing (e.g., land use analysis).
- Astronomy (e.g., galaxy classification).
## **<span class="red">Pattern Recognition Systems</span>**
- **Components**:
  1. Data acquisition and sensing.
  2. Preprocessing: Noise removal, segmentation.
  3. Feature extraction: Discriminative and invariant features.
  4. Classification: Assign objects to categories.
  5. Post-processing: Use context to improve performance.
## **<span class="red">Design Cycle</span>**
1. Data collection.
2. Feature choice.
3. Model choice.
4. Training.

6. Computational complexity.
## **<span class="red">Performance Metrics</span>**
- Error rate (probability of misclassification).
- Speed.
- Cost.
- Robustness.
- Reject option.
- Return on investment.
## **<span class="red">Learning and Adaptation</span>**
- **Supervised Learning**: Teacher provides labels for training data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: System forms clusters or natural groupings.
## **<span class="red">Summary</span>**
- Pattern recognition is crucial for many computer applications.
- It involves complex sub-problems and requires careful design.
- No single technique works for all problems.
- Context, constraints, and feature extraction are key to success.
